### Pandemic Records: Side B
> An inifinitely vertical scrolling shooter game.
> 
> 11PM arrives, and FEUP closes. With the students outside, in safety, it is up to the security guard to save the day.
> 
> Facing an invasion from the COVID forces, the guard must clear the B hall, with the help of trusty disinfectant weapons.
>
> The player earns score by killing the COVID clusters, of which there are different variants. However, one must be careful not to damage FEUP property, or the ever-so-innocent janitors which are so helpful in this task.
